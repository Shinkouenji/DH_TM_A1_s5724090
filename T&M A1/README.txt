## Digital Humanities: Tools and methods Assignment 1
### **Topic**
With the outbreak of COVID-19, governments each made their policies to combat a pandemic on a rarely global scale. I will focus on the response of the Japanese government.
### **Context**
In a in-2020-published article, Iwasaki and Grubaugh report a puzzling lack of COVID-19 cases in Japan (Iwasaki and Grubaugh, 2020). Some suggest a lack of testing (Sawano, 2020). However, Iwasaki and Grubaugh write that under-testing is unlikely to account for the lack of positive cases as there was no reported surge in death from respiratory syndromes (Iwasaki and Grubaugh, 2020). As the pandemic is still recent, there is no definitive answer as to why Japan had such a low number of confirmed cases.

### **Research question**
Is there an observable correlation between the Japanese government's COVID-19 policies and the number of confirmed cases from 15 January until 16 August 2020? 

_Hypothesis_: I do think there will be a correlation between policy and case numbers, especially because Japan also employed the go-to-travel campaign where the government subsidized travel partially for anyone in Japan who went on vacation to another prefecture.

### **How to address the research question**
Karako et al.’s article provides an overview of government measures and their timing (Karako et al., 2021). So combining a timeline of government anti-COVID-19 measures from Karako et al.’s article and a dataset with confirmed corona cases in Japan from 2020-01-15 until 2020-08-16, I want to research whether there is an observable correlation.

### **Necessary data**
The variables in the dataset I intend to use are the prefecture names, confirmed cases, confirmed deaths and recovered cases. By looking at the confirmed cases and all the prefectures together I hope to find a correlation between new anti-COVID-19 measures and changes in the amount of confirmed cases.

### **Potential tools**
For lack of a better tool, and knowledge on the researcher’s end; Google charts might be a tool to create a line graph of the time and confirmed cases. Then new measures would have to be annotated.
